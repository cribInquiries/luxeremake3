      "Our journey with this client began when he reached out looking to purchase a property with strong short-term rental potential. He wasn't just looking for a home—he was looking for an investment that would grow. From the first call, we guided him through a comprehensive analysis of several properties, breaking down projected Airbnb earnings, long-term appreciation, and renovation potential. Once he settled on the perfect location, our team at Luxe Managements took over the transformation. We re-styled and renovated the space to create a modern, warm, and highly functional Airbnb-ready home. Every detail was intentional—from interior flow and furniture selection to lighting, amenities, and guest-ready features that elevate the stay experience. By October, we launched the listing—and the results spoke for themselves. Bookings surged immediately, outperforming traditional rental income and generating the kind of revenue only a well-optimized short-term rental can achieve. What started as a search for a property turned into a high-performing Airbnb asset. The client was blown away by how seamlessly we managed everything—from purchase support to renovation to ongoing management—and how much more profit the property produced under Luxe compared to standard renting.",

We implemented our latest bedding system, prepared a premium care package, and completed a full styling and setup tailored for high–occupancy coastal stays. Within days, the home was completely guest-ready. The result? The property quickly became one of our top-performing Airbnbs in West Beach, consistently achieving high occupancy, excellent guest reviews, and returns far beyond what a regular rental could offer.

Most companies would have stopped there. We didn't. At Luxe, we've built a team that doesn't shy away from distance — they embrace it.

Added a pool table and table tennis for entertainment, upgraded the kitchen with premium appliances, styled every room with designer furniture, and created multiple living zones for guests to relax and connect. The outdoor area was transformed into an entertainment hub with BBQ facilities and comfortable seating.",

      "Upon hearing about our Enfield success story, the owner of 74 Kent Ave reached out wanting to achieve similar results for his own property. Although initially uncertain about venturing into short-term rentals due to the perceived risks, he was open to exploring the potential. The home had strong fundamentals but required additional furnishing and some maintenance work before it was ready for short-term rental platforms. Our team stepped in to coordinate the necessary maintenance, complete the furnishing, and style the home to create a warm, functional, and guest-ready space. Once listed, the property quickly gained traction across platforms, delivering returns well above what traditional renting could offer. What began as a property in need of preparation evolved into a polished, high-performing investment supported by a smooth and reliable management experience.",
